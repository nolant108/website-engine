# About Me

This site is an example of how a [JAMstack](https://www.jamstack.org) site can implement comments.

All comments are posted with a form and once approved, rendered directly onto the site via a build. No JavaScript is required to pull them into your browser for rendering.

The site is a living example and you can try commenting on the [pages](/) listed on the home page. (The [site owner](https://twitter.com/philhawksworth) will get a notification of your comment via Slack, and will need to approve your comment before it shows up, so be patient).

## Wait, what happens when I click that button?

Good question. Here's what it will do...

1. We'll clone the [git repository](https://github.com/philhawksworth/jamstack-comments-engine) of this project into your Github account. We'll be asking for permission to add the repo for you.
2. We'll create a new site for you in [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), and configure it to use your shiny new repo. Right away you'll be able to deploy changes simply by pushing changes to your repo.
3. You'll need to do a little config in order to integrate with Slack etc. There are some [instructions](https://github.com/philhawksworth/jamstack-comments-engine/blob/master/README.md) to help get you set up
4. That's it really.
