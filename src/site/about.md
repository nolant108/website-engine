## Want one of your own?

You can get your own instance of this example site up and running on Netlify very quickly by clicking the button below.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/philhawksworth/jamstack-comments-engine)


## Wait, what happens when I click that button?

Good question. Here's what it will do...

1. We'll clone the [git repository](https://github.com/philhawksworth/jamstack-comments-engine) of this project into your Github account. We'll be asking for permission to add the repo for you.
2. We'll create a new site for you in [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), and configure it to use your shiny new repo. Right away you'll be able to deploy changes simply by pushing changes to your repo.
3. You'll need to do a little config in order to integrate with Slack etc. There are some [instructions](https://github.com/philhawksworth/jamstack-comments-engine/blob/master/README.md) to help get you set up
4. That's it really.
