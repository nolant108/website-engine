### Starters
Soooo Yahh, I went to Disneyland Resort during the covid 19 Pandemic, But i think it was much better than I thought, I was thinking it was going to be more like of a VERY busy theme park, but no, it was very short, Like really quick queues. Some of the queue were like more of around 2 hours for things like Splash Moutian(They are taking the ride down and remodeling it :( sad)

So I decided to get a quick pic as this maybe the last time i ever see the ride in my life :(

     width="200" 
     height="300" />

LOL, I was able to ride the ride about 2 times pretty quickly

### Timing
Me and my father decided to stay the night in a nearby hotel for the nightbefore, so we would not have to be driving the next day

### Queues
The Queues were petty nice, not overly long
1. 50% of the rides <= 15 Minutes
