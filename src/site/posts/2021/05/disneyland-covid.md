Soooo Yahh, I went to Disneyland Resort during the covid 19 Pandemic, But i think it was much better than I thought, I was thinking it was going to be more like of a VERY busy theme park, but no, it was very short, Like really quick queues. Some of the queue were like more of around 2 hours for things like Splash Moutian(They are taking the ride down and remodeling it :( sad)
